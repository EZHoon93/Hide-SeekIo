Introduction

    Cube-style assets that create a background for arena battle games.
    
    *3D, Mobile friendly, Includes scene(Sample, Demo playable).
    *All background assets use only one material and can implement low draw calls.
    *Everything is a 3D asset and mobile-friendly (Top, Side, Quarter View, etc. Utilization is excellent)

*Note) The quality of the included scripts can not be guaranteed.(i am just artist!).

1. Folder description.
    
         -Meshs : contains “FBX”file (material removed. only mesh - just exported from 3dsmax)
         -Models : prefabs that assigned material.(we recommend using the model here.)

		 -Prefabs\Puzzle : This folder is compatible with "3D Puzzle Block Pack" (if you are not using the puzzle pack, please delete this folder).
